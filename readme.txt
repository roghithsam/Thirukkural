The Thirukkuṛaḷ is a classic Tamil Sangam literature consisting of 1330 couplets or Kurals. It was authored by Thiruvalluvar. The Thirukkuṛaḷ is one of the most important works in the Tamil language. This is reflected in some of the other names by which the text is given by such as Tamiḻ Maṟai (Tamil Bible); Poyyāmoḻi (words that never fail); and Teyva nūl (divine text).
